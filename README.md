### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm new to the world of GitHub and its many branches, but I'm always willing to learn! 

Favorite languages:
- HTML/CSS/Javascript
- C++

Learning with help from [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/) and [GitHub Skills](https://skills.github.com/). Both are **extremely** helpful tools and full of content!
