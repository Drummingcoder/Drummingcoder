### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a newbie. 
<!-- Add purposes (to show that I'm learning) -->

My Languages so far:
- HTML/CSS/Javascript
- C++

Learned from [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/) and [GitHub Skills](https://skills.github.com/). Both are **extremely** helpful tools and full of content!

I'm currently working on my Arduino Chess Clock and my Traze Maze game. I'm also making a personal website to showcase my skills, and learning from 
the OSTEP book!
